# DetectMasks
This is DetectMasks A project that we made at Hack the North 2020++, it uses Machine Learning were we made a Flask App to demonstrate a algorithm we made to detect if people are wearing masks. We used TensorFlow and Keras for the Machine Learning Model. We used Flask to make the webapp, and used OpenCV to access your webcam and live stream on our Flask Application. 


Next Steps:
- We need to style our application
- We need to add a sidebar 
- Create multiple features were you can use the Machine Learning Model on a Camera
